        <p>
            The seal of the school is made up of two concentric circles. In the outer circle is written 
            the name of the school which is <strong>ST. MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL ACADEMY</strong> and the inner circle is the picture 
            of St. Michael the Archangel holding a sword with his opened wings.

            The name <em>St. Michael</em> means "<em>who is like God</em>". It is reinterpreted as a symbol of humility before God and a 
            great prince stands up for the children of God. The <strong>SWORD</strong> symbolizes the power of God. It was St. Michael who 
            led the good angels against Satan and the angels who turned away from God. The <strong>WINGS</strong> symbolizes peace, 
            spirituality, faith, beauty, love, and protection.
