        <h2>Historical Background of Saint Michael the Archangel Academy</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>SAINT MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL ACADEMY</strong>, formerly known as <strong>HOLY CHILD CATHOLIC SCHOOL</strong>, 
            was founded by Rev. Fr. Wilfredo C. Paguio, who apparently heard the desire of the Orion community for a Catholic educational 
            institution that would cater for morally and spiritually uptight individuals endowed with special talents and abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            True enough that in 1982, the first of Pre-elementary pupils experienced the inspiring leadership and supervision of the Franciscan 
            Sisters of the Immaculate Concepcion, Sr. Carmela Gatmaitan and Sr. Belen Rodriguez. It was interesting to note that after two 
            years of committed service, the school was granted Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). During this year too, the school was 
            placed under the supervision of the Dominican Sisters with Sr. Regina Nicolas, OP as the principal.

        <p>
            The administration then felt the responsibility of extending its commitment to the community so with the turnover of leadership 
            to the new principal Mrs. Pacita Bagtas, was the opening of the Elementary education in 1985. Two years after, 
            Msgr. Romeo Banaban was assigned school director with Mrs. Rosalina Paguio as the principal. She was followed by 
            Mrs. Rowena Q. Santos, a year after the commencement of the first batch of elementary graduates in 1991, 
            Msgr. Wilfredo B. Fabros became the school director.

        <p>
            SAINT MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL ACADEMY yearned to mold and nourish the inquisitive minds through integration of faith in the context 
            quality education. This and the trust of the parents gave way to the opening of the High School Department in 1999. In the same 
            year, the HOLY CHILD CATHOLIC SCHOOL was renamed SAINT MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL ACADEMY. Three years later, the Elementary and 
            High School Department received government recognition. In 2000, the school’s vision and mission were further clarified and the 
            school placed under the supervision of the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception. In 2007, Rev, Fr. Ernesto B. de Leon 
            became the school director. That same year, SAINT MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL ACADEMY celebrated its SILVER ANNIVERSARY FOUNDATION. 
            The school year 2011-2012 saw changes when SMAA was no longer under the supervision of Fransiscan Sisters but under a member of 
            the laity as principal with Rev. Fr. Rosario V. Guila as the school director.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the first batch of high school students had graduated in 2003, SMAA qualified as a participating school for 
            ESC (Educational Service Contracting) program which aimed to help the students of the private schools through financial assistance. 
            Furthermore, SMAA reiterated its vision and mission in maintaining human formation at the core of which is JESUS CHRIST and 
            HIS GOSPEL, as the idea to strive for and to respond to the call to be a HERO.
        </p>
        <p>
            SAINT MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL ACADEMY is called by the Dioceses of Balanga to widen its vision and share in the threefold of purpose 
            of catholic education, to proclaim to the students the Gospel of Jesus Christ (KERYGMA), to enable them to experience 
            fellowship in the life of the Holy Spirit (KOINONIA); and to prepared them to a life service to the Christian 
            community and the entire human race (DIAKONIA).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is only in sharing in this total mission of the Church that SAINT MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL ACADEMY becomes a true Catholic 
            educational institution. As such, its operation and progress deserve to engage the joint participation of families, teachers, 
            various kinds of cultural, civic and religious groups, civil society and invaluable work for the church.
